- **Backend Repository:** [`<backend-repo-url>`](<https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Backend>)
- **Frontend Repository:** [`<frontend-repo-url>`](<https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Frontend>)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot, Maven, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting:** Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)

## 🛠️ How to Run
Please refer to the `README.md` file within each repository for specific setup instructions:
1.  [Backend Setup Instructions](<https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Backend/blob/b1c959e36bd7a48ae4daa66cc9a5ad31d3b31b30/README.md>)
2.  [Frontend Setup Instructions](<https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Frontend/blob/f06fd7ea324e5aea6b76bc3d643ec4fa3d652e2e/README.md>)

💡 **Note:** The backend securely manages the external API key using environment variables on Render. The frontend only communicates with our backend API, never directly with the external exchange rate service.
