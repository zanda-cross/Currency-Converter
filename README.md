- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting:** Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
Please refer to the `README.md` file within each repository for specific setup instructions:
1.  [Backend Setup Instructions](https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Backend/blob/main/README.md)
2.  [Frontend Setup Instructions](https://github.com/zanda-cross/Currency-Converter-Frontend/blob/main/README.md)
